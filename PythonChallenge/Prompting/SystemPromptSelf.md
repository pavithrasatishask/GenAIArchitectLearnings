Investment Planning Query.
User:
I’m planning to invest ₹5,00,000 for 5 years. Can you suggest how I should split it for good returns?
AI (Expected Response):
Certainly! Based on your 5-year investment horizon and medium-term growth goal, here’s a diversified plan:
Equity Mutual Funds (50%) – ₹2,50,000: Moderate risk, high potential returns. Consider funds like Axis Bluechip Fund or Mirae Asset Large Cap Fund.
Debt Mutual Funds (30%) – ₹1,50,000: Lower risk with steady returns. Options include HDFC Short Term Debt Fund.
Hybrid Funds (20%) – ₹1,00,000: Balanced risk-return profile. You could explore ICICI Prudential Equity & Debt Fund.
